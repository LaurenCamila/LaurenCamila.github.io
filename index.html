<!--TERMINOLOGY:
    Anything inside a <> that is displayed on the webpage is called an Element
    Syntax: Rules for writing the code. Like coding grammar.
    Anything inside a <> is a tag. <> is an opening tag, </> is a closing tag.
    <a> stands for anchor.
    The href bit is called an "attribute". An atribute modifies how an element behaves.
    SYNTAX RULES FOR AN ATTRIBUTE:
    - There must be a space between the attribute name and the tag name
    - There must be an equal, and after it, an attribute value, writen between ""
    We can have multiple attributes, separated by spaces.
